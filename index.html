      My name is Abby Falardeau, I am currently attending Michigan State Univeristy. My major is Games and Inertactive Media was a focus in game desin and a minor in history. I am a lover of travel and music, and wish to bring unique stories to any team I work on. My ideal position would be as a narrative designer, I am using concept design to enhance my ideas to pitch creative story boards to my future teams. I would also love to publish my own novel before I'm 30.
